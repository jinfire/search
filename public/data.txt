I'm very excited to tell you that on our
couch tonight we have a record holder
yes we do that record holder is Ace of
Butterfield now ASAP no you I mean you
are a record order aren't you oh I don't
know yeah I guess now that's what I've
been told
well he's very fast at doing something
any guesses Andrew
I'll stop you
one of the things you're very faster
right um so I can neither of them are at
all useful I can clap very fast
take that audience someone
to say I'm better at clapping than the
audience
and then I can type the alphabet very
fast as well which came about really
weirdly but now when you say very fast
tell us what's your best time my best
time for typing the alphabet is 1.97
seconds wow
and what's the world record I think it's
under one second yeah
what a waste of time be oh I know I know
it's a record attempt we're going for a
record of 10
because there is actually they've said
there is a kind of a website they've set
this up where there's a clock the
alphabet and as you type the thing the
alphabet lights up I I had one uh my
brother showed me it yes we've got it so
can you show us on this I can yeah it's
the same one well I don't know well it
was called like you're bringing your
drinks with you
okay so it's all there okay so basically
you start typing and the the clock
starts okay cheers see when I did this
the game was called finger frenzy okay
we would ask what you were Googling when
you found it
this is good okay okay come on
[Applause]
here we go
try it again reset reset reset the mouse
but reset reset reset all right the
first try okay okay there's nerves
there's nerves it's a different keyboard
like it's the best stuff best best of
twenty
yes oh
it's this game I need finger Frenzy
yeah
all right well let's try fast clapping
then
I have no idea what this is I watched a
video on YouTube of someone who actually
holds the world record again I gained
all these things off YouTube It's
amazing yeah um and so there's a
technique most people clap like this yes
it's the usual thing but if you sort of
flex
like this
and then it starts to speed up
oh
wow
I would just saying to enjoy this time
because now you can legally drink these
games are over for you
but before last time on YouTube learning
how to clap fast I promise
